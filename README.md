## Credits

To complete this app I've used steadyhealth's database of weight loss recipes which is also provided. Images inside the app are under proprietary license so these are not included.

## About app idea

This app is the perfect companion for anyone who is wondering how to lose weight fast but responsibly and healthily. It offers over 400 different weight loss smoothie recipes, which are searchable by ingredient so you can either satisfy your craving for a particular fruit or vegetable, or create a great smoothie with ingredients you already have at home. The smoothie recipes in this app are browsable online or offline, which means you’re able to tap into the inspiration you need to stay on course wherever you may find yourself. 

Smoothies, and green smoothies in particular, can be your best friend on your personal road to healthy weight loss that lasts. Smoothies are more than a tasty drink: the best smoothies offer you the perfect combination of carbs, protein, healthy fats, and vitamins and minerals. They can increase your energy levels and boost your metabolism, offering a long-term solution you won’t want to give up on even after you’ve lost your desired number of pounds, rather than a torturous weight loss diet you will get so sick of that you end up binging on junk foods.
